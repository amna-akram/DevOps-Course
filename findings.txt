Containers can share host files by using mounts (volume or bind). Containers also share host system's resources e.g. storage and CPU etc.
When using Host Network driver, the containers share the network with the host that is public. Moreover they have the same IP address as the host.
However, when for example bridge driver is used, it creates private network on the host and containers within that private network have their
own IP addresses.
